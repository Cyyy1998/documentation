Communication
=============

Often when people encounter a new community there is some uncertainity about
which place is appropriate for their particular question.

First, nobody is going to be upset if you get it wrong- as long as you abide
by our :ref:`code-of-conduct` we're glad to have you.

Recommendations
---------------

But in general here are some guidelines:

**Want to ask a general question, or have a conversation?**

    The best place is our `Slack Channel <https://openstates-slack.herokuapp.com/>`_.

    The core team hangs out there, and while we have day jobs, we're usually able
    to answer basic questions in a timely fashion.  There's also a much better chance another member of the community can help out.

**Have a private question, or a security concern?**

    Email `contact@openstates.org <mailto:contact@openstates.org>`_.  These emails are only read by the administrative team.

**Have a specific issue with Open States data?**

    File an issue on `the main issue tracker <https://github.com/openstates/openstates/issues>`_.  Please try to check for recent open reports of your issue and follow the guidelines laid out there.

**Have an issue with something else?**

    Try to find the appropriate repository if you can. For example:

        * this documentation: https://github.com/openstates/documentation/issues/
        * openstates.org: https://github.com/openstates/openstates.org/issues/

**Have a feature request or something else that doesn't fit here?**

    We use the `openstates/meta <https://github.com/openstates/meta/issues/>`_ repository
    to track feature requests and general questions.  If in doubt, it is OK to post to this     repo.  We may move your ticket to the appropriate place.


Discouraged Methods
--------------------

Examples of bad ways to get in touch:

**Personal email addresses of Open States developers.**

    We can't guarantee we'll see these in a timely fashion, and all of the above methods
    will email us and be visible to others that can help with your question anyway.  Please
    refrain from contacting any of the developers directly unless we ask you to.

**Twitter (or any other social media)**

    We mainly use the `@openstates twitter account <https://twitter.com/openstates>`_ to make announcements and don't have the resources
    to provide technical support, etc. on Twitter.

**The old Google Group.**

    Because of spam every post to the group has to be moderated, which makes it
    a much slower and less effective way to get in touch.

    We're considering deprecation of the group sometime in 2017.
